gmm-project-2012
================
Repo for everything related to my project for [Learning Grounded Models of
Meaning][gmm], a UT Grad seminar, offered in Fall 2012. 

## What are you doing?
Currently, my primary idea for this project involves applying the idea of
second-order vectors to geolocation. Thanks to Jason Baldridge for suggesting
this project.

## LaTeX
All the LaTeX sources for all the various submissions can be found under
latex/. 

### inventory
What's in there:
* acl2012.bst : styling for bibliographies
* acl2012.sty : styling for all submissions
* acl2012.tex : a neat example of a submission, with all formatting stuff.
  Handy to have easily available.
* project\_ideas.tex : my project ideas submission file.

## Wait, aren't you an undergrad?
Yeah. I'm [@raptros_][my twitter] on twitter.
