Geographic information is relevant in several contexts; for example, geographic information retrieval for exploring document collections \cite{ding2000computing}, toponym resolution in historical texts \cite{smith2001disambiguating}, summarizing travelogues and travel recommendation \cite{hao-et-al:10}, socio-linguistic studies \cite{eisenstein-smith-xing:11} and targeted advertising on the internet. With the widespread use of mobile devices, geographic information is becoming increasingly ubiquitous and important. In this project we propose a method for predicting the geographic location of Wikipedia articles with a graph based semi-supervised algorithm and a small amount of labeled data.

Prior work on geolocating Wikipedia articles (\cite{wing-baldridge:11} \cite{rolleretal:12}) has so far only used a subset of the English language Wikipedia for training; specifically, it uses those articles that already have geolocation tags associated with them. 
These articles constitute a relatively small portion of the English language Wikipedia. \comment{find actual figure} This is not surprising, since most articles on Wikipedia are not about geographic locations, or objects at specific locations.
On the other hand, the number of articles that have links to or from such geolocated articles is much larger, which can be a potential source of useful information. \comment{ find actual figure}

Earlier approaches used geotagged article content indirectly by first building unigram language models from the text of the articles during training, and then comparing similarity of test documents with these language models. This ignores the potentially useful information present in the  hyperlinks between articles, which is a strong indicator of semantic and geographic relatedness, and hence can be used to improve prediction accuracy.

Another assumption inherent in prior work is that each article is associated with a single location, i.e. the location specified by the geo-tag. While this is a fair assumption for some articles, e.g., those about historical monuments and physical objects, this assumption is not necessarily valid for articles about geographically distributed concepts such as states (e.g., Texas) or personal biographies (e.g., George Washington). 

Our hypothesis is that we can infer the location for non-geotagged articles by using the location information present in other geotagged articles that they link to, or receive incoming links from.
Unlike prior work, our approach makes use of the link structure of the articles in addition to the text based language models.
We use the label propagation algorithm to infer a distribution over locations for each non-geotagged article starting from a small seed set of geotagged articles. This in turn would allow us to include the text from newly geo-tagged articles in the language models for the locations they are strongly associated with.

So far, the majority of our time has been spent dealing with a host of technical issues that we need to solve in order to set up our preprocessing and evaluation system. These are explained in the current status section. We have updated the next steps section to account for these issues.
