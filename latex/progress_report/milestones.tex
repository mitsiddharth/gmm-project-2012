\section{Milestones}
These are our estimated deadlines for completing significant milestones in the project.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Nov. 13:} Set up and run Textgrounder and Junto on the TACC cluster. Run the grid cell extraction scripts on Textgrounder logs.
    \item \textbf{Nov. 20:} Get the Wikipedia link graph, either by extending the functionality in Textgrounder, or from other projects.
    \item \textbf{Nov. 27:} Run label propagation on the Wikipedia link graph and compare geolocation accuracy with Textgrounder.
    \item \textbf{Dec. 04:} Tune the parameters of the Label Propagation algorithm and test other hypothesis about graph structure.
    \item Measure accuracy of label propagation on non-geotagged documents and evaluate their usefulness for creating language models for Textgrounder.
\end{enumerate}
