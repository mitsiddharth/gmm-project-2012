\section{Introduction}
%motivation - why do we want to do this?
%well, so that we can investigate the geolocation thing on the much larger non-geotagged section of wikipedia!
%of course, this isn't straightforward
Prior work applying geolocation models to Wikipedia has been limited to a small portion of its articles;
this is simply because most Wikipedia articles do not have geolocation tags.
This should not be suprising, since most articles on wikipedia are not about specific locations, or objects at specific locations.
However, there are plenty of articles that may be associated with multiple places; for example, biographical articles may refer to the various locations the subject has lived.
Using label propogation, it may be possible to get sensible locations associated with the larger set of unlocated Wikipedia articles.

\section{Related Work}
%Geolocation
Geolocation has been implemented as an information-retrieval task, as in
\cite{skiles:12}; IR-based implementations divide the world up into cells, each
of which are considered to be a pseudo-document consisting of text from every
document appearing in that cell.
The simplest approach is to divide the world into uniformly-sized cells, but
\cite{rolleretal:12} use kd-trees to build cells with uniform amounts of text.
This adaptive grid approach is available in the Textgrounder package.

\section{Plans}
\par %simple eval
How does label propagation perform in comparison to Textgrounder?
In order to evaluate this, it can be tested on the labeled set of articles the same way as textgrounder is tested -
labels are left off for a test set, label propogation is run, then the predicted labels are compared to the actual locations of the test set.
Labels will have to be cells on the map; in the simple case, these are uniformly sized cells.
A more complex version would use cells produced by Textgrounder's kd-trees.

\par issues:\\
-predicted locations from label propogation\\
-what are the labels going to be? uniform bins vs. kd-trees\\
-extending to full set.


what other things do we want to try?
